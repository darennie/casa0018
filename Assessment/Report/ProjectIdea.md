# Project Idea

## Title: Does my pint need to be filling?

---

## Idea:

Complete the sentence:

**I want my project to be able to detect whether or not a glass is more or less than half full using the camera on my arduino or phone.**

---

## Data:

Also think about: I will use a specific pint glass at home and fill it with a dark liquid (coke or stout) and take pictures of it filled to varying amounts saying whether or not it should be topped up. I would capture this data myself using my phone at home. I will try to vary backgrounds around the house as best I can so it doesn't pick up on unexpected cues.

Note: in addition to editing the text here, also remember to add the above information to one sticky note on the Miro board.
