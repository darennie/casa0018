# Project Idea

## Title: Does my pint need filling?

---

## Idea:

Complete the sentence:

**I want my project to detect whether or not a pint glass is more or less than half full using the camera on my Arduino or phone.**

---

## Data:

Also think about: I will use a specific pint glass (or maybe multiple) at home, fill it with a liquid, and take pictures of it filled to varying amounts, saying whether it should be topped up. I would capture this data myself using my phone or Arduino cam at home. I will try to vary the house's backgrounds as best I can so it doesn't pick up on unexpected cues.

Note: in addition to editing the text here, also remember to add the above information to one sticky note on the Miro board.
